# myApp/api/models
### Purpose
This is the directory that holds your models.  In Sails, models are the structures that contain data for your Sails App.

When you call `sails generate api cats` via the command line from inside your project's root directory, Sails will generate the file `myApp/api/models/Cat.js` as well as a matching controller.  In that file you can put lay out how the records in your database will look and function.
